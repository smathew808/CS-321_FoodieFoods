#CS-340-SequentialALignment, A Bioinformatics application Project Objective: Compare between two sequences of characters. Run the Sequential Alignment Algorithim to determine a score of how similar the sequences are to eachother.


#Program Directions:

1) program will ask you to pick between LCS or optimalSeqAlignment

2) If you pick LCS then you have to pick two words for LCS

3) Otherwise you will pick OptAlignment

4) additionally you will have to choose gap, match, dissimilar and similar scores

The console will output the final score for both algorithims
